# Running-with-the-Sun

2D Case Study.

- Used Unity Free 2d Platforming game asset as shown on the following link :
  
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/free-platform-game-assets-85838

- Sample Player image provided by the above asset is used for testing.
- Camera and the sample background image follows the player. Animations are missing but modularly programmed to be added later on.
- A state machine is formed to process idle, walk, run and jump states of the player.
- You may press shift to run and press space to jump.
- Prefabs are spawned based on observer pattern. Four sample prefabs are created with sprite renderer to be processed.
- Relevant events are created and Invoked at specific intervals in order to instantiate the prefabs.

Work ongoing. NO idea why I named it "Running-with-the-Sun".
